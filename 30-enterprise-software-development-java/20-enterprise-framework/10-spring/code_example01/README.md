# Code example: Tax System

This example contains a full stack java application. 
The purpose of this example is going through the code without any prior knowledge to figure out by yourself what all this new syntax means.

## Goal
The goal is to get yourself acquainted with larger code bases containing a lot of new syntax.
Because after the course this will be your first challenge.
If this sounds like a lot of work, don't worry. 
We'll explain everything in more detail the coming weeks.
 
Another goal is to provide a bit more context before we start with the theory, hopefully making things easier to understand.

## Task
Give an explanation in your own words of every annotation (the things that start with an @-sign), new file types and new java class suffixes that you see in the project (basically anything new).
Don't lookup the meaning of the syntax, but try to figure it out by yourself.
We'll discuss your findings after 2-hours.

You can ignore following annotations and files for now:
- @Transactional
- @Entity
- @Table
- @Id
- data.sql

Will be seeing these when we're starting with ORM.

## Some hints
Don't know where to start? Following these steps might help.
1. What does the application do?
1. Try to get the application running. Where is the start button?
1. Send some http-requests to the application.
    1. To send a request to your own pc use localhost or 127.0.0.1 as host name.
    1. Which kind of calls can you do?
    1. Which code will be executed after a call?
1. Can you change the behaviour from belgian to american?
1. Can you add new kind of behaviour for example a french one?
1. Querying a person will not return that persons job. Can you extend the code so that it does?
1. Go over each annotation (@-signs). What does it do? Remove and/or modify it to see how it works.
