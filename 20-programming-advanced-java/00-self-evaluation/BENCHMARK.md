# Benchmark

This benchmark contains a list of essential codelabs (and questions) which are all part of the modules we have already covered.
You should make sure to solve all of these codelabs! By succeeding in doing so, 
you'll be ready to take on the next step in Java software development. 

## Inheritance, Composition, Abstraction, Interfaces and Polymorphism

### Questions
- Make sure you know the difference between **inheritance** and **composition**
- Make sure you know what **polymorphism** is
- Make sure you understand **interfaces** and that they're also useful for **composition**

### Codelabs
- **Codelab05** (Movie Rental V2) in module `inhertance-composition`
- **Codelab06** (Battle sim.) in module `inhertance-composition`
- **Codelab02** (Treehehehe) in module `polymorhpism-abstraction-interfaces`

- **Codelab06** (Swappable Bonus calculators) in module `polymorhpism-abstraction-interfaces`
- **Codelab08** (Mails) in module `polymorhpism-abstraction-interfaces`

## Exception handling

### Questions
- Make sure you know the difference between `Errors`, `Checked` and `Unchecked` exceptions
- Make sure you know the difference between the `throw` and `throws` keyword
- Make sure you know how to `try{...} catch(...){...}` an exception
- Make sure you know when you should and when you shouldn't throw exceptions!
    - *What is the intended behavior?*
    
### Codelabs
- **Codelab01** (Exceptions) in module `10-exception-handling`
- **Codelab02** (Exceptions V2) in module `10-exception-handling`
- **Codelab03** (It's a date) in module `10-exception-handling`
- **Codelab08** (Strict bank account) in module `10-exception-handling`
- **Codelab09** (Exceptional) in module `10-exception-handling`

## Data structures

### Questions
- Make sure you know the difference between an `array` and a `List`
- Make sure you know the difference between a `List`, a `Queue`, a `Map` and a `Set`

### Codelabs
- **Codelab02** (Warming-up) in module `list_queue` 
- **Codelab03** (Deck of cards) in module `list_queue`
- **Codelab05** (Airport watchtower) in module `list_queue`
- **Codelab01** (Birdy birdy in the sky) in module `set_map_comparators`
- **Codelab02** (Country map) in module `set_map_comparators`
- **Codelab04** (Blog) in module `set_map_comparators`

## Generics

### Questions
- Make sure you know what generics are, and why they were introduced in Java.

### Codelabs
- **Codelab00** (Box) in module `generics` 
- **Codelab02** (Generic swapper) in module `generics` 
- **Codelab04** (Habitats for Animals) in module `generics` 
- **Codelab05** (Optimized ArrayList) in module `generics`

## Nested classes and Lambda's

### Questions
- Make sure you know it's possible to create nested classes
- Make sure you know what lambda's are and how to use them
    - **Note:** They're only available in Java 8 and up

### Codelabs
- **Codelab03** (Callback) in module `40-nested-classes-lambdas`, package `nested_classes` 
- **Codelab04** (Bob the builder) in module `40-nested-classes-lambdas`, package `nested_classes` 
- **Codelab01** (Sorting personas) in module `40-nested-classes-lambdas`, package `lambdas` 
- **Codelab02** (Now, with lambda's!) in module `40-nested-classes-lambdas`, package `lambdas`

## Streams

### Questions
- Make sure you know what streams are and how to use them
    - **Note:** They're only available in Java 8 and up
    
### Codelabs
- **Codelab011** (Now, with lambda's!) in module `50-streams`
    - **Note:** Codelabs01 - 10 are all pretty interesting since they explore different possibilities of streams. 
    However, it's up to you if you explore them all.
