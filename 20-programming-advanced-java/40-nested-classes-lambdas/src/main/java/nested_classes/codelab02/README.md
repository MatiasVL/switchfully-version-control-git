# Garbage

1. Create a class Garbage with a nested class Factory
2. Create a method in Factory that creates an instance of Garbage, which it *stores*.
3. Should Factory be static or not?
4. Give Garbage a field that can hold multiple (not a fixed number) String objects.
5. Create a method on Factory that can add Strings to that field, this is the only method that can change the field.
6. Create a method on Garbage that prints every String of that field.
7. Create a Factory instance outside the Garbage class (e.g. in a Runner class), add some Strings and call the print method
