# Driving Sim

Expand the provided code with extra functionality:
- Implement an **UNDO** operation for each of the following behavior
    - a driver enters a car
    - a driver leaves a car
    - the car's lights are turned on
    - the car's lights are turned off
    - the car's engine is turned on
    - the car's engine is turned off
    - the car's driven for a certain amount of miles

Refactor the code, using a behavioral design pattern, so that it works just as before, 
but also includes the new **undo** behavior

There are numerous tests available, refactor them if needed!
In the end, they should all be green (again).
