# Book repo

Create a class BookRepository that accepts new books. 

Whenever a book has been added or removed from the repository we want to do 3 things:

- Print a text in the console
- Save the repository to disk (fake this by doing a sout saved to disk)
- Send an email (fake this by doing a sout email send)

This could be extended in the near future.

Use the Observer behavioral pattern.
