# Fill me up!

You have 3 classes that you cannot change:

- Car with a method fillMeUp();
- Bus with a method fillMeAlready();
- Truck with a method fillMeSlowImOnABreak();

Create a ServiceStation class that has only 1 method and can fill the 3 vehicles.
- No class-type checking, casting

Which Structural pattern would we use?
