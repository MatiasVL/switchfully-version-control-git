# GRASP
Only one excercise:

GRASP stresses the importance of a good design. 
Use GRASP to see why the gameoflife exercise is an example of poor design.
- Go over the GRASP principles and verify them against the current code
    - do they apply here?
    - are they violated?

Use GRASP to improve the design.
- Try to come up with a solution that is more inline with GRASP
- Draw your design and discuss with your pair before implementing 
- Implement your solution
    - What improved using GRASP?
    - What are the drawbacks?
    
**Take your time with this exercise. 
Focus on a good design first.**
