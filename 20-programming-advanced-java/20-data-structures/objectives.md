# Data Structures
- I can choose and use the right data structure based on my requirements
    - I know that I can use a List to have an **ordered** group of elements
    - I know that I can use a Set to have a group of **unique** elements on which I can do mathematical operations
    - I know that a Queue can be used to **handle** elements following the **FIFO** principle
    - I know that I can use a Map to store a group of elements that I quickly can look up with a certain key.
    
- I know some general specifics
    - I know about util classes like Collections and how to use them
    - When I write data structures I write against an interface
    
- I know some specifics about lists
    - I know that a list uses an array in the background
    - I know that a list can become infinite long
    - I can order a list
        - I also can order a list based on a custom comparator
    - I can loop over all elements of a list
    - I can in one line create and assign values to a list using a library function
    
- I know some specifics about sets
    - I know how the uniqueness is checked
    - I know the importance of the equals() and hashcode() function and what their difference is

- I know some specifics about maps
    - I can access the different parts of a map: keys, values, entryset
    - I know the importance of the equals() and hashcode() function and what their difference is
    - I can lookup a key based on its value
