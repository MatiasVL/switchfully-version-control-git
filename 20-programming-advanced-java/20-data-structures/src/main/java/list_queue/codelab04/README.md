# Word reader

Write an application which reads in an array of words (look below for some examples)
stores them in an list and allows to do the following:

- A method that iterates over the list, printing out all the words as such.
- A method that: 
    - Capitalizes all the plural words (assumption: if a word ends with an "s", it's written in plural)
    - Prints the entire modified list
- A method to reverse the order or the list and then prints the entire list
- A method to remove all the plural words from the list and then prints the entire list
