# Game of Life - Switchfully

Game of Life Code Kata!

Using Maven, Angular (4+) and Spring Boot (2.0.4.RELEASE)

## Usage

- If it's your first time using this application, read the **First time usage** section first... :)
- Start the backend by running `GameOfLifeApplication.java`
- Start the frontend with command `npm start` from inside `gameoflife-ui/gameoflife-app`

## First time usage

- Install Node.js (it will also install npm)
- After installation
  - run `node --version` from inside the terminal, if it's correctly installed it will return a version number
  - run `npm --version` from inside the terminal, if it's correctly installed it will return a version number
- Run `npm install` from inside `gameoflife-ui/gameoflife-app`

## Some tips

- Tip 1: Run your entire build and all (backend) tests with command `mvn clean install` from inside the root folder (switchfully-gameoflife)
    - Tests run on JUnit 4, not 5!
- Tip 2: the UI won't work properly without a running backend.
- Tip 3: You don't have to make any changes to the UI
- Tip 4: You can access the frontend by surfing to http://localhost:4200
