# Generic swapper

Write a generic method to exchange the positions of two different elements in an array.
The method should return the new array (wherein the two elements have been swapped).

- As parameters, provide the array itself, the index of the first element to swap and index of the second element to swap.
- As return type, use the type of the array.
