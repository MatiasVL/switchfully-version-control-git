# Generic count

**Note:** This really is a difficult exercise. However, it does show the true powers of generics for creating reusable,
generic methods (and classes). Make sure you understand the solution, however,
we do not require you to solve this one (but do give it a try). :)

Write a generic method to count the number of elements in a collection that have a 
specific property (for example: odd integers, prime numbers, palindromes).

- You should pass in the collection and the property
- Only add 1 to the count if the property is met.
