# Optimized ArrayList

Create a class OptimizedNumberArrayList
- It should extend the ArrayList class
- It should only be able to hold `Number` elements, or any of its subtypes
- It should override the set method
    - only if the element at the provided index is not equal to the provided element, should we set it
    - We always return the provided element
