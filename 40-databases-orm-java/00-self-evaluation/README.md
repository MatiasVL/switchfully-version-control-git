# Self evaluation 4: Örder

As the self evaluation, we'll develop the GUI of the Örder application.

- The actual assignment can be found in `60-projects/order` and `60-projects/order/gui`
- Solely focus on the frontend, reuse your Örder backend or use the finished version that's on the Switchfully GitHub.
- Since this is a self evaluation exercise, work individually.
