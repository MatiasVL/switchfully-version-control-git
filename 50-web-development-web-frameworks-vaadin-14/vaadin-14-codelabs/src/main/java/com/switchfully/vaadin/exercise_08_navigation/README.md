# Exercise 8 - Navigation

Add an Accomodation Detail View that is opened when you click on a result in the list.
Use the Vaadin `Navigator` to navigate between the list and detail views.

Make the detail View have a different url, such as: /accomodation/{id} so that this page is bookmarkable and supports the back button.
