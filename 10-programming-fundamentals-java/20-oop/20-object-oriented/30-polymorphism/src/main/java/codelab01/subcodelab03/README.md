# Animal kingdom

Create a logical inheritance tree of the following concepts.
Firstly, draw it out on paper, using the correct UML notation.
Afterwards, implement it in code (to prove your solution works)

- Tiger
- Muridae (mouse-like)
- Cat
- Animal
- WhiteShark
- Wolf
- Mammalia (mammals)
- Dog
- Gerbil
- Killer (e.g. EvilRobot and WhiteShark are killers)
- Peacock
- Robot
- Felidae (cat-like)
- RobotDog
- EvilRobot
- Pet (e.g. RobotDog, Cat and Dog are pets)
- Canidae (includes domestic dogs, wolves, foxes, jackals, dingoes)

Some questions: 
- Which classes should best be abstract?
- Do we need interfaces or can we do without them here?
