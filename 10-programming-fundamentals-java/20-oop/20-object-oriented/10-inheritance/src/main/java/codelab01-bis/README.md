# Inheritance

We've created the next classes without any real content. 
This is just used for grasping the concept of extending a class:
- A class polygon
- A class triangle
- A class quadrangle
- A class rectangle
- A class square

Describe their relationship in code (using the extend keyword)!
When you're done, run the InheritanceTest test-file.
The tests should be green.
