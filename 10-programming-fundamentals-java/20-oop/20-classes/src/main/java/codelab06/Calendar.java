 * Design and implement a Calendar, consisting of entries, that have a (simple) Date, a start time, end time, and a title.
 * Add a way to add entries to a calender, but don't allow overlapping entries (write tests for this, try to do this first).
 * Provide a way to print an overview of a particular day in the Calendar.
