# Inheritance V2

Create the following classes, but do not (yet) create any relationships between them:
- A class Bike
- A class PickUp
- A class SportsCar
- A class PedalBike
- A class HeavyTruck
- A class Bus
- A class Vehicle
- A class Truck
- A class Convertible
- A class Car
- A class MediumTruck
- A class HarleyDavidsonMotor
- A class VolvoV40

Use the following procedure:

1. On paper, draw the relations between the classes using the UML notation.
2. Give your solution (on paper) to your neighbour (and receive his or her's).
4. Write tests (see codelab01: InheritanceTest), based on the solution of your neighbour.
5. All tests should fail
6. Implement the relations using the extends keyword.
7. All tests should be green in the end.
