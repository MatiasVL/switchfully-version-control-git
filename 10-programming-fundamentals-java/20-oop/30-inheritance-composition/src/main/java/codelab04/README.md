# Bank Accounts V2

As a bank owner I want to have bank accounts with a person, balance and an account number. 
Depending on the account type we have 4 different withdrawal rules.

- CHEAP: You may only withdraw 100 euro a day, you can never have a negative balance.
- LOW: You may withdraw up to 1000 euro a day, but you can never have a negative balance.
- MEDIUM: You may withdraw up to 2000 euro a day, you can have a negative balance but if you start the withdrawal transaction negative you cannot do the withdrawal.
- RICHBOY: You have no limits.

The person should have a birthdate and a name. 

Question: Which part is composition, which part is inheritance?
