Run the tests.
Remove the existing equals method.
     Go to menu Code > Generate, pick equals() and hashCode(). Hit next a few times (the defaults are fine).
     You can ignore the hashCode() function for now.
Study the generated equals method and explain to someone else what it does.
Run the tests again, they should all be green
Change the add(Time other) method so that it becomes a pure method!
     Hint: No idea on what pure and impure methods are? Read the README.md file!
Review the documentation of java.awt.Rectangle.
     Find a method which is pure? Find one which is a modifier (impure)?
     Discuss with someone!
Review the documentation of java.lang.String.
     Why can we say String is an immutable class (tip: look at the class definition)?
     Discuss with someone!
