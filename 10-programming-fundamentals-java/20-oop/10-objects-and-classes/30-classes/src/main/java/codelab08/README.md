# Movie Rental

Design and implement a movie rental service. 
Limit yourself to classes:
 - Movie (title, price, genre), 
 - Rental (returnDate, movie, customer), 
 - Customer (name, birthday, age)
 - RentalService (customers, movies, rental).

Think about how objects of these classes should work together.
In the end, you should use and execute the MovieRentalRunner to launch your rental application 
to let a customer rent 3 movies.
