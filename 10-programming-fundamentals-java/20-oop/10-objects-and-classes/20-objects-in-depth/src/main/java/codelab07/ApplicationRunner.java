     * Create a BigWindow object (width 1000 and height 450)
     * Create a BigCanvas object
     *      Create Shape objects (BigCircle, BigSquare and BigTriangle) and add them to the BigCanvas object.
     *      (3 houses, 1 sun in total: read below)
     * Add the BigCanvas object, as a "component" to the BigWindow object
     * Call the method to launch the BigWindow object.
     *
     * Run the application, we want to see the following:
     *      A completely red house on the bottom-left
     *      A house with a black roof and a yellow building in the bottom-middle
     *      A completely blue house on the bottom-right
     *      A yellow sun on the top-right
     *
     * Hint:
     *   - A house is made with one BigSquare and one BigTriangle
     *   - A sun is made with BigCircle
     *
     * Extra:
     *   When you change the dimensions of the BigWindow object, our houses and sun should adapt to this new size.
     *   The sun should always be located to the far-left, -right or middle of the window.
     *   Hint: use the getWindowsDimensions() method on BigWindow.
