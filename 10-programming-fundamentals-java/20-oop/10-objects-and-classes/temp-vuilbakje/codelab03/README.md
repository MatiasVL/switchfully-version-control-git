# Scrabble

- Write a definition for a class named Tile (in other words, create Tile.java which is a class) that represents Scrabble tiles. 
    - The instance variables should include a character named letter and an integer named value.
    
- Write a constructor that takes parameters named letter and value, and initializes the instance variables.

- Write a method that takes an integer parameter named multiplier, and that returns the value of the tile multiplied by the multiplier.

- Implement the toString and equals methods for a Tile.

- Create ScrabbleRunner, a class which can be executed. In it, create an array with 7 Tiles (you decide which tiles).
Then, loop over the array, printing each tile.
