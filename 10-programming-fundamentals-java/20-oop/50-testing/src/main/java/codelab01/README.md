# Your first test!

Test the following logic: Within a person class we have the method calculateChildAllowance(). 
This is a method we can use to calculate the allowance a child should receive. 

The formula is described as: 
- When a person is between 0 and 12 they receive an allowance of 100 euro. 
- When a person is between 13 and 18 they will receive an allowance of 100 euro 
and an age addition of 5 euro for each year after 12. 

For example:
- 13 will receive 105
- 18 will receive 130
