# Employee

- Create a class Employee, this should contain a name and a basic annual salary.
- Calculating the monthly salary is highly dependent on the type of employee:
    - A normal employee gets 1/12 of the annual salary and in december he will get a bonus of 1/12 of the annual salary
    - A manager gets 1/12 of the annual salary and a bonus each month determined by the workload of the manager. 
    The bonus formula is workload * 1000. In december he will get a double bonus: workload * 2 * 1000
